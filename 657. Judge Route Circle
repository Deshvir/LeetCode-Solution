/**
* Initially, there is a Robot at position (0, 0). Given a sequence of its moves, judge if this robot makes a circle, 
* which means it moves back to the original place.

* The move sequence is represented by a string. And each move is represent by a character. The valid robot moves are
* R (Right), L (Left), U (Up) and D (down). The output should be true or false representing whether the robot makes a circle.

* Example 1:
* Input: "UD"
* Output: true

* Example 2:
* Input: "LL"
* Output: false
