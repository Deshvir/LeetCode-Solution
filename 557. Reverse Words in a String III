/**
* Given a string, you need to reverse the order of characters in each word within a sentence while still preserving 
* whitespace and initial word order.

* Example 1:
* Input: "Let's take LeetCode contest"
* Output: "s'teL ekat edoCteeL tsetnoc"
* Note: In the string, each word is separated by single space and there will not be any extra space in the string.
